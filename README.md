Visual Browser for HeadRush速 Pedalboard Rigs and Blocks

## why

HeadRush Pedalboard does not have a librarian/editor and it can be difficult to view all of your patch settings on the device itself without a lot of paging and scrolling.

This provides an easy way to visualize all your rigs and block settings in a convenient browser. It is READ-ONLY. No editing or librarian features are provided as that would require knowledge of the HeadRush Pedalboard USB-sync protocol, and that should be something provided by the manufacturer if they choose.

## compatibility

This software is compatible with HeadRush速 Pedalboard Firmware version 2.3.0. No guarantees it will work with other versions as the manufacturer may change the format of it's data schema at their disgression. No guarantees it will work with older versions of the firmware.

It may also work with HeadRush Gigboard Firmware version 2.3.0 but I have not tested that as I do not own that device.
